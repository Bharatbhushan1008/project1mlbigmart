Big Mart Sales Prediction Project Summary:
Title: Big Mart Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

Description:
Developed a predictive model to forecast sales of various products at Big Mart outlets based on historical sales data. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and implementation of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Key Highlights:

Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding to ensure data quality.

Performed EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and trends in item sales.

Built and evaluated models using RMSE and RÂ² score to compare accuracy.

Achieved improved prediction performance by tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.

Deployed insights to identify high-performing item types and store characteristics.

Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

Goal:
To assist Big Mart in optimizing inventory planning and boosting sales through accurate demand forecasting.
